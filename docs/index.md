# KYMail Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for KYMail - a modular email processing system built with Python 3.10+ that implements a microservice-like architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Project Overview

KYMail is designed around a pipeline flow: **Identity → Ingest → Message → Analyzer**, where each component operates independently while communicating through well-defined protocols. This architecture enables scalable email processing, semantic analysis, and intelligent insights extraction from email data.

### Key Features

- **Protocol-based Architecture**: Type-safe contracts between all components
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure Gmail integration with token management
- **Local Email Processing**: Maildir format support with folder organization
- **Semantic Analysis**: Sentiment analysis, topic extraction, and conversation insights
- **Modular Design**: Independent development and testing of each component

### Core Components

- **Interface**: Protocol definitions and contracts for all modules
- **Identity**: OAuth authentication and secure token management
- **Ingest**: Email fetching and parsing from local maildir sources
- **Message**: Standardized message representation with attachment handling
- **Analyzer**: Semantic analysis and metadata extraction capabilities
